# Python-Image-Download
Script that retrieves an image from a user-defined URL and saves it locally. I used this as part of a project to regularly scrape images from a streaming nature cam and post them to twitter.

## Getting Started

Set the url to scrape from here: `url = 'http://192.168.1.22/picture/1/current/'`

Set filename for local image here: `with open("image.png", "wb") as code:`
